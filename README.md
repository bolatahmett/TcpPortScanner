# TcpPortScanner
Find open tcp port async
Port Scan Tool
Scenario
You are developing a multi-threaded desktop application which will scan open ports in a given
IP range. The application should be performing TCP requests to all IPs in the given range and
visualize the open ports in the UI.
Objectives
● There should be a slider in the UI to determine how many parallel tasks should be
running.
● The port scan should be terminable at any time from the UI.
● Detected open ports should be shown in the UI immediately.
● You can use UI Framework of your choice (i.e WinForms or WPF).
● Write production-grade code, including exception handling, logging, comments etc.
where appropriate.
● Create a Git repository for this project and push it to a provider of your choice (i.e
GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) when you are done with the assignment.
● You have 72 hours to complete the assignment. Email us back with the link of the
repository and a ready-to-use executable of the tool.
Bonuses
● Parallel task slider to take effect immediately during a scan.
● Fully Asynchronous application.
● Usage of MVVM
