Port Scan Tool
Scenario
You are developing a multi-threaded desktop application which will scan open ports in a given
IP range. The application should be performing TCP requests to all IPs in the given range and
visualize the open ports in the UI.
Objectives
- There should be a slider in the UI to determine how many parallel tasks should be
running.
- The port scan should be terminable at any time from the UI.
- Detected open ports should be shown in the UI immediately.
